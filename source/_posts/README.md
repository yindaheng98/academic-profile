# About Me

I am a PhD student at [Simon Fraser University](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/edulab/), advised by [Prof. Jiangchuan (JC) LIU](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~jcliu/). 
I received my Master's degree at [Southeast University](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/edulab/), advised by [Prof. Fang Dong](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0102/c23024a256994/page.htm),
and my Bachelor's degree from [Jiangnan University](https://www.jiangnan.edu.cn/) in 2020, advised by [Prof. Ya Guo](https://iot.jiangnan.edu.cn/info/1141/3512.htm).
My research interests include optimization and application of multimedia systems.
My goal is to build systems that can achieve high-quality multimedia communication at a low cost for everyone.

# Research Interest

* Live video streaming
